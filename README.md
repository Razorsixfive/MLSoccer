## Introduction

The Unity Soccer Environment is a state-of-the-art platform designed to teach agents the art of teamwork and strategy in soccer. This project explores the fascinating world of machine learning, allowing agents to learn and adapt their gameplay in a dynamic and competitive soccer environment.

## Learning Process

Our project's learning process revolves around enabling agents to:

1. **Initialize:** Agents are equipped with team affiliations (blue or purple), positions (striker, goalie, generic), and initial positions.

2. **Act and Decide:** Agents take discrete actions, such as moving, rotating, and kicking the ball, while making decisions based on their observations and the game state.

3. **Rewards and Penalties:** Agents receive rewards or penalties for their actions, enhancing their learning process. Goalies receive existential bonuses, while strikers face existential penalties.

4. **Learn through Interaction:** Agents learn by actively engaging with the environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

5. **Train and Reset:** Agents go through training episodes and adapt to new scenarios as the environment resets periodically.

## Understanding Machine Learning

In this environment, machine learning, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), plays a pivotal role. Key components of RL include:

- **State Space:** Representation of the environment's current state.
- **Action Space:** The available actions for agents.
- **Policy:** The learned mapping from states to actions.
- **Rewards:** Feedback guiding the learning process.
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Balancing the exploration of new actions and the exploitation of known rewarding actions.

## The Chosen ML Method: Proximal Optimization for Cooperative Agents (POCA)

Our selected ML method is Proximal Optimization for Cooperative Agents (POCA). POCA is a specialized algorithm designed for cooperative multi-agent environments. It excels in scenarios where agents must collaborate and coordinate actions to achieve common objectives.

## Comparison with Other Options

Compared to single-agent RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), POCA offers distinct advantages in multi-agent settings:

- **Cooperation:** POCA is explicitly designed for cooperative multi-agent environments.
- **Coordination:** It enables agents to coordinate their actions effectively for collective optimization.
- **Multi-Agent Training:** POCA is tailored to address challenges specific to multi-agent training, where agents' actions affect both each other and the environment.
